# Setting up the push server on Debian 13

This folder is the server that sends **Service Alerts** to the web app as
notifications, so they arrive while SG Bus Timing is closed. It polls LTA's
train service alerts and traffic incidents once a minute, and when something
changes it sends a Web Push message to every device that turned alerts on,
filtered by the device's choice of **All updates** or **Disruptions only**.

It is modelled on alarm-clock's push server, and can run on the same VPS next
to it: that one uses port 8787, this one 8788.

You'll end up with:

- the Node server running as a systemd service on `127.0.0.1:8788`
- your existing nginx in front of it, serving `https://push.sgbus.uwuapps.org`
  with a Let's Encrypt certificate from certbot
- data in `/var/lib/sgbus-push/`

It takes about 15 minutes. Set the server up **before** deploying the site
changes. The site still works without it: the Service alerts card shows
what's happening, but picking **All updates** or **Disruptions only** says it
couldn't reach the alerts server until the server answers.

## 1. Point a subdomain at the VPS

Add DNS records for `push.sgbus.uwuapps.org` wherever `uwuapps.org`'s DNS is
managed (for a domain on Vercel: **Domains → uwuapps.org → DNS Records**):

| Type | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A` | `push.sgbus` | your VPS's IPv4 address |
| `AAAA` | `push.sgbus` | your VPS's IPv6 address (skip if it has none) |

Check it from your own computer. It should print the VPS's IP:

```sh
nslookup push.sgbus.uwuapps.org
```

> Want a different hostname? Use it everywhere this guide says
> `push.sgbus.uwuapps.org`, and change `API_BASE` in `main-site/js/alerts.js`
> to match.

## 2. Install Node, certbot and git

Skip anything already there from alarm-clock's push server. SSH into the VPS,
then:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm git certbot python3-certbot-nginx
node --version
```

nginx is already running on this VPS and keeps ports 80 and 443, so this
doesn't install another web server.

`node --version` must say `v20.6` or newer. Debian 13's own package is v20,
which is fine.

## 3. Open the web ports

nginx already serves on 80 and 443, so these are probably open. Port 80 is
needed for the certificate check. If you use `ufw`:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 80,443/tcp
sudo ufw status
```

Port 8788 stays closed, because the server only listens on `127.0.0.1`.

## 4. Get the code

```sh
sudo git clone https://github.com/augy-studios/sgbus-timings.git /opt/sgbus-timings
cd /opt/sgbus-timings/push-server
sudo npm ci --omit=dev
```

If the Telegram bot already runs from a clone of this repo on the VPS, you can
use that clone instead: change `WorkingDirectory` in
`deploy/sgbus-push.service` to its `push-server` folder.

## 5. Create the keys and config

Generate the VAPID keys, which identify your server to the browsers' push
services. These are **new keys for this site**, not alarm-clock's:

```sh
cd /opt/sgbus-timings/push-server
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

It prints a **Public Key** and a **Private Key**. Put them in the config file.
`.env.example` starts with a dot, so plain `ls` doesn't show it; `ls -a` does.

```sh
sudo cp .env.example /etc/sgbus-push.env
sudo chmod 600 /etc/sgbus-push.env
sudo micro /etc/sgbus-push.env
```

Fill in:

- `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`: the two keys you just made.
- `VAPID_SUBJECT`: `mailto:` plus an email address the push services can
  contact, e.g. `mailto:augybiz@gmail.com`.
- `LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY`: your LTA DataMall key, the same one the bot uses.
- Leave the rest as they are.

Save with `Ctrl+S`, then quit with `Ctrl+Q`.

> **Generate the keys once and keep them.** Every subscription is tied to
> them. New keys mean every device has to turn Service Alerts off and on again.

## 6. Start the service

```sh
cd /opt/sgbus-timings/push-server
sudo cp deploy/sgbus-push.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now sgbus-push
sudo systemctl status sgbus-push
```

`status` should show `active (running)` and a line like
`sgbus push server on http://127.0.0.1:8788, 0 devices loaded`. Press `q` to
leave it.

Quick check from the VPS:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8788/healthz
```

That should print `{"ok":true,"devices":0}`.

## 7. Add an nginx site for it

```sh
cd /opt/sgbus-timings/push-server
sudo cp deploy/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/sgbus-push
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/sgbus-push /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

`nginx -t` checks the whole config before anything reloads. If it complains,
your other sites keep running as they were. Fix what it names, then run the
line again.

Then get the certificate:

```sh
sudo certbot --nginx -d push.sgbus.uwuapps.org
```

certbot adds the HTTPS part to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/sgbus-push`,
reloads nginx, and renews the certificate on its own. If it asks whether to
redirect HTTP to HTTPS, say yes.

Check from your own computer:

```sh
curl https://push.sgbus.uwuapps.org/healthz
```

You should get the same `{"ok":true,...}` reply, now over HTTPS.

## 8. Deploy the site

Deploy `main-site/` to Vercel as usual. `VERSION` in `sw.js` is already bumped
for this change.

## 9. Try it

On your phone:

1. Open <https://sgbus.uwuapps.org/>. If you already had it open, press
   **Reload** on the update bar.
2. Tap **Service alerts**, then **All updates**, and allow notifications. The
   note under the buttons should say what you'll be notified of. If it says it
   couldn't reach the alerts server, see Troubleshooting below.
3. Close the app fully.
4. Traffic incidents change every few minutes, so with **All updates** a
   notification usually arrives within a quarter of an hour. Tapping it opens
   the Service alerts card.

On the VPS, `curl http://127.0.0.1:8788/healthz` should now show
`"devices":1`.

### What to expect per platform

- **Android (Chrome, Edge, Samsung Internet):** works in a browser tab or as an
  installed app. If notifications arrive late, set the browser or app to
  *Unrestricted* under **Settings → Apps → Battery**.
- **iPhone / iPad:** only works once the app is added to the Home Screen
  (**Share → Add to Home Screen**), opened from there, and given notification
  permission there. Safari tabs can't receive push.
- **Desktop:** works while the browser is running, even with the tab closed.
  Nothing arrives once the browser itself is quit.

## Updating later

After you change anything in `push-server/` and push it:

```sh
cd /opt/sgbus-timings
sudo git pull
cd push-server
sudo npm ci --omit=dev
sudo systemctl restart sgbus-push
```

## Troubleshooting

**Logs:**

```sh
sudo journalctl -u sgbus-push -f        # the server
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log   # nginx
```

**The card says it couldn't reach the alerts server.** On a computer, open
DevTools → Console on the site and look for `service alerts unavailable:`.
Common causes:

- `https://push.sgbus.uwuapps.org/healthz` doesn't answer: go back to steps 6
  and 7.
- A CORS error: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `/etc/sgbus-push.env` must be exactly
  `https://sgbus.uwuapps.org` (no trailing slash). Restart after editing it.
- iPhone not using the Home Screen app: see above.

**`train fetch failed` or `traffic fetch failed` in the logs.** LTA refused or
didn't answer. `replied 401` means `LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY` is wrong. Anything else
is usually LTA itself; the server keeps retrying, and logs once more when it
recovers.

**certbot can't get a certificate.** The DNS record isn't pointing here yet,
or port 80 is blocked (step 3, including the provider's firewall).

**`502 Bad Gateway` from `https://push.sgbus.uwuapps.org`.** nginx is fine but
the Node server isn't running. Check `sudo systemctl status sgbus-push` and its
logs.

**`push to ... failed: 403`** in the logs. The VAPID keys changed after devices
subscribed. On each device, turn Service Alerts off and on again.

**`dropped expired subscription`** in the logs. This is normal. That device
revoked permission, uninstalled the app or cleared site data, so the server
forgets it.

## Testing locally

```sh
cd push-server
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # fill in keys from: npm run vapid, and your LTA key
npm run dev
```

To use it from a local copy of the site, add the local site's origin (e.g.
`http://localhost:3000`) to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env`, and temporarily point
`API_BASE` in `main-site/js/alerts.js` at `http://localhost:8788`.

## Backups and privacy

Everything the server knows is in `/var/lib/sgbus-push/`:

- `devices.json`: each device's push subscription and its mode, All updates or
  Disruptions only. No accounts, names, locations or email addresses.
- `state.json`: what the two LTA feeds looked like at the last poll, so only
  changes are announced.

Losing them just means each device re-sends its choice the next time the app
is opened, and the first poll afterwards records a fresh baseline without
announcing anything.
